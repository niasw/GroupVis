##Introduction

Group is a complex mathematical structure used for symmetry analysis in Physics and Chemistry. All the information in a group can be presented by elements and their triadic relations (namely multiplication table), which is quite similar with information in a network --- nodes and relations. In this assignment, we are trying to visualize the triadic relations in a group and see if this will help us obtain properties of this group easier and faster.
